## How to Create a New Commit

1. **Stage Changes**: Add the files you want to commit to the staging area.
   ```sh
   git add <file-name>
   ```
   To add all changed files:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit Changes**: Create a new commit with a descriptive message.
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

3. **Push Changes**: Push the commit to the remote repository.
   ```sh
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

Replace `<file-name>` with the name of the file you want to add and `<branch-name>` with the name of your branch.
